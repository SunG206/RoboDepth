# RoboDepth Competition @ ICRA 2023

Welcome to the [RoboDepth Competition](https://robodepth.github.io/)! :robot:
- This is the **first** challenge on robust depth estimation under corruptions, which is associated with the 40th IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation ([ICRA 2023](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.icra2023.org/welcome)).
- In this competition, we target on probing the **Out-of-Distribution (OoD) robustness** of depth estimation models under common corruptions.
- There are **18 different corruption types** in total, ranging from three perspectives: weather and lighting conditions, sensor failure and movement, and data processing issues.
- There are **two tracks** in this competition, including self-supervised depth estimation of outdoor scenes (track 1) and fully-supervised depth estimation of indoor scenes (track 2).
